"""
This module contains the Timer class.

The Timer class is used to measure the execution time of code.
It includes methods for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer,
as well as getting the elapsed time.

Typical usage example:

    >>> timer = Timer()
    >>> timer.start()
    >>> # Some code here...
    >>> timer.end()
